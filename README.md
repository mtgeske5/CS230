1. Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements
The Gaming Room is a client specializing in interactive, competitive gaming applications. Their flagship game, Draw It or Lose It, is currently operational but needs to expand onto multiple operating platforms and embrace modern architectural approaches to meet scalability and performance demands. The client sought a comprehensive software design document to guide the development of this expansion, ensuring compatibility across various platforms, effective memory and storage management, and robust security for user data.

2. Strengths in Developing the Documentation
One area I excelled in was clearly outlining the operating platform recommendations and mapping them to the client’s needs. I provided detailed explanations of how cloud-based and cross-platform development could address their scalability and performance challenges. Additionally, I effectively communicated technical decisions in a way that both technical and non-technical stakeholders could understand, making the document accessible to a broader audience.

3. Benefits of the Design Document Process
Working through a design document was invaluable for organizing thoughts and aligning design choices with user and client requirements before writing a single line of code. It allowed me to systematically break down architectural decisions, and anticipate potential challenges. The pre-coding clarity streamlined the development process and reduced the likelihood of significant rework.

4. Opportunities for Improvement
If I were to revise one part of my work, it would be the distributed systems and network design section. While I included robust solutions for real-time communication and redundancy, I would improve by providing more concrete examples of protocols or frameworks that could be used. Adding flow diagrams or architectural sketches would further enhance clarity.

5. Addressing User Needs in the Software Design
Interpreting the user’s needs was central to this project. By understanding that users value real-time interactivity, minimal latency, and secure gameplay, I incorporated solutions such as load balancing, redundant systems, and robust authentication mechanisms. Addressing these needs ensures a seamless user experience and fosters trust, which is crucial for the success of gaming applications.

Considering user needs is critical because the end-users determine the application’s success. A well-designed application that fails to meet user expectations will not achieve its objectives, regardless of technical sophistication.

6. Approach to Designing Software
My approach to designing software involved collaborating with the client to clearly define functional and non-functional requirements, as well as, choosing platforms and frameworks that align with scalability, performance, and cost goals.
For future projects, I would use strategies such as developing early-stage prototypes to validate ideas with stakeholders. I believe it will also be important to incorporate feedback throughout the process.
